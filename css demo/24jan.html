        KTM is known for its off-road motorcycles (enduro, motocross and supermoto). 
        Since the late 1990s, it has expanded into street motorcycle production and 
        developing sports cars – namely the X-Bow. In 2015, KTM sold almost as many 
        street as off-road bikes.

        When you have some text, how can you choose a typeface? Many people—professional designers included—go through an app’s font menu until we find one we like. But the aim of this module is to show that there are many considerations that can improve our type choices. By setting some useful constraints to aid our type selection, we can also develop a critical eye for analyzing type along the way.
