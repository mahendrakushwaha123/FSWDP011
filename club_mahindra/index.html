        About The Resort
       </div> 
       <p>The Resort is an American dark 
        comedy mystery television series 
        created for Peacock by Andy Siara. 
        The series stars William Jackson 
        Harper and Cristin Milioti as a married 
        couple on vacation at a holiday resort for 
        their 10th anniversary, where they are drawn 
        into a mystery that took place fifteen years before

        A Day at Club Mahindra Assonara,Goa
        </div>
        <p>A resort is a place used for relaxation, vacation or as a daytime getaway. 
            While this can be a single building such as a hotel, it also can be an 
            entire island or a ship at sea. One of the most desirable aspects of a 
            resort is that visitors are freed from most daily responsibilities, 
            which are usually taken care of by the facility's staff. Several activities 
            are normally offered at resorts, including massages, meals, cosmetic treatments 
            and live entertainment.
